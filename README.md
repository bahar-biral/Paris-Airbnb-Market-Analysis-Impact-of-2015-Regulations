# Airbnb Paris Market Analysis: Impact of 2015 Regulations

## Project Goal  
This project investigates how the 2015 regulatory changes in Paris affected the local Airbnb market. Specifically, it analyzes shifts in new host registrations, pricing trends, neighborhood-level impacts, and differences in pricing strategies between Superhosts and regular hosts.

## Key Questions (KPIs)  
- How did the number of new hosts evolve following the 2015 regulations?  
- What were the overall trends in average Airbnb prices?  
- How did price changes vary across different Paris neighborhoods?  
- How did Superhosts' pricing strategies compare to those of regular hosts?

## Methodology  
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing including date conversion and removal of listings with missing or zero values in key columns.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Time-series analysis to track annual new host registrations and average prices.  
  - Geographic analysis measuring price change percentages per neighborhood.  
  - Comparative analysis of pricing trends between Superhosts and normal hosts.  
- **Visualization:** Clear and insightful charts to communicate findings effectively.

## Key Insights  
- **Reduced Supply, Increased Prices:** A marked decrease in new host registrations after 2015 coincided with an overall increase in average listing prices.  
- **Geographic Disparities:** Central and high-tourism neighborhoods experienced the most significant price hikes.  
- **Divergent Host Strategies:** While regular hosts increased prices, Superhosts lowered theirs, likely aiming to maintain occupancy and high review ratings.

## Conclusion  
The 2015 regulations had multifaceted impacts on the Paris Airbnb market, influencing supply, pricing, and host behaviors differently across segments and locations.
